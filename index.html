    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am an undergraduate student deeply interested in art history, curatorial studies, and the appraisal of artworks.
      My academic and career goals are focused on combining historical research with modern exhibition practices,
      aiming to work in museums, galleries, or the art market as a researcher, curator, or art appraiser.
      Through my studies, I also explore the use of digital tools such as design software and coding
      to enhance curatorial storytelling and research documentation.
